[x] recv creates identity on frontend
[] recv creates new inbox document
[x] recv registers (did) or (recv inbox doc id) on ENS
  [] integrate that into the app.
[x] recv spins up IPFS node on his machine, connects browser client to it (for pubsub)
[x] recv starts odb in browser, topic {recv.did}

[x] create / load identity on smtp service for sender
[x] sender spins up IPFS node on his machine (for pubsub)
[x] send mime message from mail client {subj, to, msg}
[x] smtp service creates a ceramic doc out of that, controlled by sender
[x] stmp service adds an ODB log entry with {recv.inbox | msg doc id} to topic {recv.did | recv.inboxdocid}

[-] recv hears the update on his ODB, reads the last log entry
  needs to be fixed

[x] recv reads message doc
[] recv add message doc to his inbox doc

[] check if the owner / controller of a doc can add other controllers (to define who may write messages on his "inbox" document)
[] add an user's inbox doc id (ceramic) / public key (textile) to ENS (could be left up to the user)
[] add an user's inbox doc id (ceramic) to IDX
[x] resolve an user's inbox doc id (ceramic) / public key (textile) on ENS

[x] write an smtp server (see https://github.com/mohamedmansour/w3c-cemail/pull/2) that receives mime messages by an email client and runs **locally** on the user's machine (therefore be considered a secure environment)

[] authenticate the smtp server
  upon setup user must authenticate inside the smtp server. That involves:
    (ceramic) adding private keys (the seed, actually) to be able to sign messages on behalf of the user 

[] (either) build an POP/IMAP service that also runs on the user's machine (along the SMTP service) and reads messages from his (ceramic) document / (textile) inbox (see https://github.com/mohamedmansour/w3c-cemail/pull/1/files#diff-d00c8cf58e8e1c820939ce5c0663a57eafa9ccf4810f9ec75eeeda5d7cd46b07R100 TextileApp.tsx, Line 100)

[] (or) build a frontend that replaces / supports the "inbox" view and reads the (ceramic) inbox document / in a web browser (needs to identify with the same private key / metamask signer that has been used for the SMTP service)


frontend seed, break it, if you want so:

Ideas

[] add ENS alias entries for email address names (stefan@elmariachi.eth)
  : did.stefan -> did of stefan 
  : did.info   -> did of info@elmariachi.eth 
  or handle this information by yet another ceramic document!
